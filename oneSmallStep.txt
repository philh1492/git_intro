**** Getting Started with git & Github*****

Following steps from The Odin Project to clone git repository.

---October 8th, 2022---

In the Terminal, create a directory/folder. Use "repos" to make it simple. ( mkdir repos; cd repos;) make directory "repos"; change to directory "repos".

To clone your repository from github; create repository, then in its settings select clone, ensure it is the SSH option. Copy address in the box.
In the Terminal, enter "git clone <SSH Address>".
To ensure it worked, change directory to your repository (cd <repo>). 
Check remote status with "git remote -v". Should show fetch/push origins.

Create file/folder in  repository folder.

Check "git status". Will mention untracked files (files that have not been added to commit).

To add items to commit:
    
    git add <filepath/file>
    ** check status in between
    
    git commit -m "<Add message>"

Congrats. It's a first step into a terrain you're not entirely familiar with yet. Keep at it and it will become your playground.
